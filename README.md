# Bike-Sharing program for Des Moines

## Overview of the statistical analysis

The purpose of this project is to obtain statistical parameters based on the Citi Bike program established in New York. The result will be the statistical reference to build a similar business located at Des Moines. The data source was extracted from this website: https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html. The historic records are available to the public. The summary of the statistical results will be displayed in different charts designed in Tableu with the title [NYC_Citybike Analysis](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/joel4774/viz/NYC_Citibike_Challenge_JFC/NYC_Citibike_Analysis). This document will include screenshots and comments for each item. 

## Results

1. Total number of trips: Based on the historic data, the total amount of trips is 2,334,224. This is an objective result that proves the reliability of the business. 

2. Gender Breakdown: From the gender breakout (pie chart located on the upper left corner on the first view), we can observe a high demand of male users. This parameter should be crossed with the population in that area. As a general reference we can use the data from https://worldpopulationreview.com/states/new-york-population. Here we can find that the female population is 51.5% while the male population is 48.5%. That means that even when the male population is lower than the female, they represent the major consumer of bike rental services. This is an important detail to consider because that means that there are other parameters to analyze in Des Moines. For example, the average income or age. 

3. Average trip duration vs Birth Year: The senior population is responsible for the largest number of rental hours. The average age in New York is 39 which means the City Bike logistic may include strategies to be in senior areas.

4. Checkout Time by Gender: These results confirmed the point 1, males are the regular consumer of bike services. Based on data retrieved from the bikes, the checkout time doesn’t exceed the 50 minutes. We may need to analyze more details about this result, but we can conclude that the trips are for short periods of time.

5. Trips by Weekday for each hour: The heatmap located at the left side of the next view provides details of what times the business registered more service requests. Clearly there is a preference for the morning hours, after business hours and weekends. This estimation makes sense considering the daily activities of the population (regular business hours and day-offs in weekends).
  
6. User trips by Gender by Weekday: On the next heat map we are going to analyze the trips during the weekdays based on the gender. Let's start with the subscriber group; the female gender tends to rent bikes on Thursdays and Fridays. Coincidentally, those are the days with higher demand by the male gender. On the “customer group”, the most popular days are Saturdays and Sundays. This may be caused by the tourist flow during those days.

7. Trips by Gender: This graphic could be a complement of the result 6. The pattern for the most popular time to request the service is the same for the female and male group.

## Summary

These are the summary for the [NYCity bike analysis](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/joel4774/viz/NYC_Citibike_Challenge_JFC/NYC_Citibike_Analysis)

- Based on the results from New York we can confirm that the bike service is a profitable business. The number of users and rentals displayed on the previous chart supports this statement.
- At an older age, the use of bicycles increases. This is because adults tend to seek low-impact activities in order to maintain a more active life. This justification could be used as part of the business entry campaign in Des Moines.
- Subscribers tend to use the bikes the last days of the week (going into the weekend). This can be caused by working hours, usually the last days of the week are more comfortable for outdoor activities. This means that bikes must be 100% ready and available in order to take advantage of customer demand. 
- During the week you can also see the trend of increasing use after office hours. This conclusion applies for both gender groups.

8.	Bike utilization: Based on this widget, there are some bikes that are more booked that others. This could be caused by different factors like location, condition, or brand. Once the business proposal is approved by investors, we should include a deep analysis of why some specific equipment is more popular amongst consumers.

9.  Top 5 Start Station/Top 5 End Station: The locations to pick up and drop off the bikes are important. Coincidentally, the most popular places for both actions are the same places. This is important to keep in mind when making strategic decisions, not only to place the bikes but also it can be used to make agreements with local businesses around the areas. Maybe, as an additional research, we should visit the locations in New York to observe what businesses or attractions are around the most popular start and end stations.
