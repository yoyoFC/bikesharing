# Bike-Sharing program for Des Moines

## Overview of the statistical analysis

The purpose of this project is to obtain statistical parameters based on the Citi Bike program established in New York. The result will be the statistical reference to build a similar business located at Des Moines. 
The data source was extracted from this website: https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html. The historic records are available for the public. 
The summary of the statistical results will be displayed in different charts desgined in Tableu. This document will include screenshots and comment for each item. 

## Results

1.Total number of trips : Based on the historic data, the total amount of trips is 2,334,224 trips. This is objective result that proves the reliability of the business. 

2. Gender Breakdown:From the gender breakout (pie chart located on the upper left corner on the first view), we can observe a high demand of male users. This parameter should be crossed with the population in that area. As general reference we can use the data from https://worldpopulationreview.com/states/new-york-population, here we can find the female population is 51.5% and the male is 48.5%. That means, even with the male population e is lower than the female they represent the major consumer of bike services. This is an important detail to consider, because that means there are other paramteres to analyze in Des Moines. For example, average income or age. 

3. Average trip duration vs Birth Year: The senior population is responsible for the largest amount of rental hours. The average age in New York is 39 which means the CIty Bike logistic may include strategies to be in senior areas.

4. Checkout Time by Gender: This results confirmed the point 1, the male gender is the regular consumer of bike services. Based on data retrieved from the bikes, the checkout time dont excede the 50 minutes. We may need to analyze more details about this result but we can conclude that the trips are for short period of times.

5. Trips by Weekday for each hour: The heatmap located at the right side of the next view, provides details about what times the business registered more services request. Clearly there is preference for morning, after business hours and weekends. This estimation makes sense considering the daily activities of the population. (regular business hours and day off in weekends)
  
6. User trips by Gender by Weekday: On the next heat map we are going to analyze the trips during the weekdays based on the gender. Let's start with the subscriber group, the female gender tends to rent bikes Thrusdays and Fridays. Coincidentaly those are the days with higher demand on the male gender. Something to keep in mind is the days on the customer group, the most popular days are saturday and sunday. This may be caused by the tourist flow during those days.

7. Trips by Gender: This graphic could be a complement of the result 6. The pattern for the most popular time to request the service is equivalent for the female and male group.

## Summary

Link for the Story presentation: ["https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/joel4774/viz/NYC_Citibike_Challenge_JFC/NYC_Citibike_Analysis"]

- Based on the results from New York we can confirm the bike service is a profitable business. The number of users and rentals displayed on the previous chart support this statement.
- At an older age, the use of bicycles increases, this is because adults tend to seek low-impact activities in order to maintain a more active life. This justification could be used as part of the business entry campaign in Des Moines.
- Subscribers tend to use the bikes the last days of the week (going into the weekend). This can be caused by working hours, usually the last days of the week are more comfortable for outdoor activities. This means that bikes must be 100% ready and available in order to take advantage of customer demand.
-During the week you can also see the trend of increasing use after office hours. This conclusion applied for both gender groups. 

## Additional visualization:

The last view of the story published in Tableu shows additional charts as complement of the analysis.
  
8. Bike utilization : Based on this widget, there are some bikes that are more booked that others. This could have different factors like location, condition or brand. Once the business received the approval by investors, we should include a deep analysis of why some specific equipment are more popular for the consumers. 

9. Top 5 Start Station/Top 5 End Station : The location to pick up and drop off the bikes are important. Coincidentally, the most popular places for both actions are the same places. This is important to take strategic decisions, not only to place the bikes it can be use to arrange agreements with local business around the areas. Maybe as additional research, we should visit the locations in New York to observe what business or attractions are around the most popular start and end stations.
